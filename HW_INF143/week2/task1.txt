Assume an OTP-like encryption with a short key of 128 bit. This
key is then being used periodically to encrypt large volumes of data.

• Is this scheme breakable with a ciphertext-only attack?
  With a ciphertext-only attack you would have no idea what the text actually translates to, and the
  only thing you might be able to chase is the frequency. However, OPT is strictly uniform and doing so
  would be a goose chase.

• Is this scheme breakable with a known plaintext attacks? What about its
  resistance against a chosen plaintext attack?
  With a known plaintext attack you would only know the plaintext and not its relation to the cipher key.
  You might be able to find some pattern that makes sense with respect to how a one-time-pad works, but not
  knowing more about the pattern you will have no chance at breaking it.

  With a chosen plaintext attack and a small key being used periodically you will have a greater chance at
  breaking the cipher. However, to actually get somewhere you would have to know where the key begins and where
  it ends (With respect to the plaintext\ciphertext).
