Why a brute-force attack does not work on a small message of 5 ascii characters
revolves around why the cipher is not breakable against known plaintext attacks.
It is uniform and there is no practical way of breaking it even if you might
be able to translate it to english words. You might be able to get multiple keys
that translates those 5 ascii characters to different words and have no clue as
to which one is the correct one to use.
