Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is an encryption program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication. PGP is used for signing, encrypting, and decrypting texts,
e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase
the security of e-mail communications. Phil Zimmermann developed PGP in 1991. PGP encryption uses a serial combination of
hashing, data compression, symmetric-key cryptography, and finally
public-key cryptography; each step uses one of several supported algorithms. Each public key is bound to a username or an e-mail
address. The first version of this system was generally known as
a web of trust to contrast with the X.509 system. PGP has some
interesting features. One is the public key fingerprint, which is a
shorter version of a public key. From a fingerprint, someone can
validate the correct corresponding public key. A fingerprint like
